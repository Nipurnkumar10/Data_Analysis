# Data_Science_Social_Media_Analysis

This project explores engagement trends across different social media platforms using a dataset that includes 100 social media posts from Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Each post is analyzed based on attributes like post type, time, day, sentiment, and its engagement metrics: likes, comments, and shares.

# Objectives:
Identify which platforms and content types drive the most engagement.

Understand how timing, day, and sentiment affect user interactions.

Use SQL queries to extract meaningful insights and patterns from the data.

# Key Insights:
Instagram had the highest average engagement compared to Facebook and Twitter.

Polls and Videos were the most engaging post types overall.

Posts published at night and on weekends received more interaction.

Negative sentiment posts surprisingly generated more engagement on some platforms.

Most common post type on Instagram was images, but videos performed better in terms of engagement.

Over 60% of posts crossed the 1000 likes mark, indicating strong user interaction trends.

# Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how data-driven insights can guide content strategy across platforms. By understanding the types of posts, optimal times, and user sentiments that drive engagement, social media managers can optimize posting behavior and improve reach.
